#  Statement Coverage
This white box testing technique ensures that every statement in the source code is executed at least once. It covers all paths, lines, and statements within the code. 

# Branch Coverage
Branch coverage measures the percentage of the branches(decision points,e.g. if-else statements,switch statements) has been executed in the source code. It ensures how well the test cases navigate through different possible outcomes of conditional statements.

# Predicate Coverage
In predicate coverage, test cases measure how effectively they explore all the possible paths or results of conditional statements in the code. By doing so, they help assess how completely the code has been tested, ensuring that various decision points and conditions are checked for different scenarios.
